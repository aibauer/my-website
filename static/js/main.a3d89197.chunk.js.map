Tech. My concentrations are in Intelligence and People, and I have interests in product management, human computer interaction, and big data. This summer, I am working as an Enterprise Transformation Intern at Grant Thornton where I will be doing product management work on different technology products within the accounting industry. </p>         \n              <p>Prior to my enrollment at Georgia Tech, a majority of my ventures revolved around soft skill development. For four years I served as the volunteer director of the Teams For Kids Foundation, Inc., a 501(c) non-profit organization founded in 2014 that seeks to provide children from underserved families in New Jersey with the ability to participate in sports. I maximized fundraising through writing grants, planning events, direct mail solicitations, and launching the organization’s largest initiative: The Student Athlete Ambassador Program. Through these experiences, I learned valuable skills of leadership, verbal and written communication, and collaboration.</p>      \n              <p>More recently, my well-developed soft skills have become complimented with technical skills. During the Fall 2020 semester, I worked as a Data Scientist and Engineer for the Discussion Forum sub team of the Data Driven Education Vertically Integrated Project at Georgia Tech. On this team, I collected and analyzed data from the academic discussion boards of Georgia Tech’s learning management systems using languages and packages such as python, pandas, and numPy. Additionally, I supported the front-end team through the use of python libraries such as matplotlib and bokeh to visualize this data. Ultimately, my team and I used natural language processing and sentiment analysis techniques to create python scripts and visualizations to be used in a web application with the goal of aiding Georgia Tech professors in their instruction. Additionally, this team utilized agile methodologies with weekly Scrum-style stand up meetings and an interation plan.</p>\n              <p>Furthermore, I have experience in software and application development. I have completed coursework in object-oriented programming, and in data structures and algorithms. Additionally, I have completed a project-based course where I developed a farm simulation game on a 5-student team. Through this experience, I became accustomed to object-oriented analysis and design as well as project management practices such as agile development, the unified process, and UML diagraming. During the Spring 2021 semester, I began my Junior Design Project, where I have been writing user stories, creating UX prototypes, and performing user research while working directly with an assigned client with the goal of developing a biometric authentication system and web application to be used by Georgia Tech students.</p>\n              <p>Outside of academics, I am an active member of my fraternity, Alpha Epsilon Pi at Georgia Tech, where I currently serve as Vice President and as Philanthropy Chair. I also previously served as Social Chair (I held the position during COVID-19, how fun!). Additionally, I play on the Georgia Tech Club Ice Hockey Team and used to play the trombone in a jazz combo at Georgia Tech. In my free time I enjoy watching sports, reading and learning basketball statistics and analytics, listening to music, and trying new foods.</p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        \n      );\n  }  \n}\n\n\nexport default About;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/vis.73fcfe41.jpg\";","import React, { Component } from 'react';\n\n//components\nimport proj1 from \"./files/vis.jpg\";\n//includes\n\n\n  class Projects extends Component {\n    render() {\n      return (\n        <div className =\"container-fluid\">\n          <div className=\"projTop\">\n            <h1>\n                Projects\n            </h1>\n          </div>\n          <div className =\"projContainer\">\n            <img src = {proj1} alt=\"vis\" />\n            <div>\n              <a>Characterizing Aircraft Incidents Dashboard</a>\n              <p>Utlized d3.js and bootstrap to create interactive info vis dashboard used to characterize distributions of aircraft incident data provided by a given csv file.\n                Completed as final project for Information Visualization course.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      );\n  }  \n}\n\n\nexport default Projects;","\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport {\n  HashRouter as Router,\n  Route,\n  Link\n} from 'react-router-dom';\n\n//components\nimport Header from './Components/headerComponent/header';\nimport Footer from './Components/footerComponent/footer';\nimport HomePage from './Components/pages/homePage';\nimport About from './Components/pages/aboutPage';\nimport Projects from './Components/pages/projectsPage'\n\n//includes\nimport './Assets/css/default.min.css';\n\n  class App extends Component {\n    render() {\n      return (\n        <Router basename = '/'>\n          <div className=\"App\">\n            <Header />\n              <Route exact path='/my-website/' component={HomePage} />\n              <Route exact path='/' component={HomePage} />\n              <Route exact path='/About' component={About} />\n              <Route exact path='/Projects' component={Projects} />\n            <Footer />\n          </div>\n        </Router>\n      );\n  }  \n}\n\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
