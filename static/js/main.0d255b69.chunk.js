For four years I served as the volunteer director of the Teams For Kids Foundation, Inc., a 501(c) non-profit organization founded in 2014 that seeks to provide children from underserved families in New Jersey with the ability to participate in sports. I maximized fundraising through writing grants, planning events, direct mail solicitations, and launching the organization\u2019s largest initiative: The Student Athlete Ambassador Program, where I recruited and worked with high schoolers from 15 different high schools in the state of New Jersey, who raised funds and awareness to support the organization\u2019s mission. The program was awarded a New Jersey State Governor\u2019s Jefferson Award in the Youth Volunteer Group category in 2019, while I personally was a medalist for the 2018 New Jersey State Governor\u2019s Jefferson Award in the Service to Youth category.

During the Fall 2020 semester, I worked as a Data Scientist for the Discussion Forum sub team of the Data Driven Education Vertically Integrated Project at Georgia Tech. On this team, I collected and analyzed data from the academic discussion boards of Georgia Tech\u2019s learning management systems using languages and packages such as python, pandas, and numPy. Additionally, I supported the front-end team using python libraries such as matplotlib to visualize this data.  Ultimately, my team and I used natural language processing and sentiment analysis techniques to create python scripts and visualizations to be used in a web application with the goal of aiding Georgia Tech professors in their instruction.

During the Spring and Fall 2021 semesters, I completed my Junior Design Project: a biodiversity surveying game called ATL Wildin\u2019. I worked primarily as the front-end developer of this team, utilizing HTML, Javascript, CSS, bootstrap, and python to develop the user interface of the web application, which was a game where users would be presented photos of animals taken on Georgia Tech\u2019s campus greenspaces, and would be prompted to tag the images to identify the animal presented as a means of data collection. The application was a Django web application, using mySQL databases and a file share server to store information on the image and animal data.
